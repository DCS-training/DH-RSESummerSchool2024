# Day 4: 5 July 2024, Edinburgh, UK

## Collaborating on Code

**Instructors**: Federico Nanni, Rosie Wood, Ed Chalstrey, Kaspar Beelen - The Alan Turing Institute

Collaboratively writing and reviewing code is a crucial skill for working as part of a team. Keeping track of 
outstanding issues and proposed solutions, as well as ensuring compatibility of code written by different team members 
becomes challenging as the team size grows. In this hands-on workshop, we will review the "Git flow" framework for 
efficiently organising and tracking collaborative programming, and practice creating GitHub Issues, Git branches, and 
Pull Requests. A basic familiarity with Git and the GitHub interface is recommended.

**Pre-workshop preparations**:  
- Please make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- This workshop assumes basic knowledge of version control with Git. If you have not used Git before, please familiarize yourself with it by completing [this workbook on Git basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uO8f0j62-5FkLkDHht9xOj-XFbr0RTF9sukWCig42vk/edit).
