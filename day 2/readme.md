# Day 2: 3 July 2024, Edinburgh, UK

## Sustainability

Sustainability is about ensuring the continued existence of your work, for yourself and others, now and in the future. It can include things like ensuring your code remains functional, understandable, usable and accessible, and coping with changing circumstances. Sustainability can be challenging, but there are strategies that you can adopt. While there is no single, definitive thing that makes your project sustainable, there are categories of ‘best practices’ you can choose for your project, depending on what you are trying to achieve and how much time you have available.
