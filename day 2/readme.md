# Day 2: 3 July 2024, Edinburgh, UK

## Sustainability

Sustainability is about ensuring the continued existence of your work, for yourself and others, now and in the future. It can include things like ensuring your code remains functional, understandable, usable and accessible, and coping with changing circumstances. Sustainability can be challenging, but there are strategies that you can adopt. While there is no single, definitive thing that makes your project sustainable, there are categories of ‘best practices’ you can choose for your project, depending on what you are trying to achieve and how much time you have available. 

**Instructors**: [Mary Chester-Kadwell](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/about/people/dr-mary-chester-kadwell/), [Jonathan Blaney](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/about/people/jonathan-blaney/), [Lidea Shahidi](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/about/people/lidea-shahidi/) ([Cambridge Digital Humanities](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/))

#### Repository links for Jonathan's talk and exercise

These are all public repositories. In the talk I will be critiquing:

- https://github.com/psf/requests
- https://github.com/jonathanblaney/theses-urls

In the exercise you can choose to look at one (or more) of these repositories. Different programming languages are represented here: how much does it matter if you know the particular language when you evaluate the repository? Some of these relate to academic projects and some do not: what difference does that make?  Some haven't been updated for a few years: does that mean you wouldn't use it?
