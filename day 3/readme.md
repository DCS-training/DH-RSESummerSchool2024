# Day 3: 4 July 2024, Edinburgh, UK

## Digital Creativity for research, engagement and impact

**Instructors**: Elliott Hall, Neil Jakeman

King's Digital Lab has needed to respond to requests from researchers to incorporate digital creative 
technologies in their digital research outputs. Creative collaborative activities often require us to work 
differently; to adjust our practices which have evolved to deal with Digital Humanities projects of a more
traditional sort.

We will talk about some of these challenges and together, we will try to address a design challenge based on
an imagined scenario.
